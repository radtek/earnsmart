\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Application pool is the central class that holds user created applications. 

\-Form the user perspective this class provides an \-A\-P\-I for mounting user application to the \-Cpp\-C\-M\-S service.

\-There are two kind of {\itshape mount\/} member functions, that allow\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-Mounting a {\itshape factory\/} of user applications -\/-\/ for execution of synchronous requests by multiple instances of application.
\item \-Mounting single application -\/-\/ for processing asynchronous requests by single instance of an application
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-The life cycle of synchronous application is defined by application pool itself, and the life cycle of asynchronous depends on its own reference count.

\-This class is thread safe and can be accessed from multiple threads simultaneously.
