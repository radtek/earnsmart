of Fundamentals</span></b></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#616161'>We have found a novel way for value investment. We all love to
trade in stock, bond or option of a publicly listed company. But our ride on
the road to successful investments is not safe if we don't know the inner
truths of how a company may perform in the future given a number of
circumstances, internal or external to the company.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#616161'>This is what this site is good at doing. We have built an excellent
prediction algorithm. This algorithm has the ability to rummage through
innumerable macro-economics and micro-economics data, the company
and its competitors fundamentals and many more, then build a complex graph and come to a conclusion
on how a company may end up in a future quarter, quarters or years.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#616161'>Just click on a point inside the densely populated area on the
scatter plot and you will draw a line between the return of a risk-free asset to
the return-risk position you choose on the graph (y and x axes). A table captures all the
potential companies that may be safe to invest in. It is suggested to have a
protective put in case the prediction failed - which is a possibility for a few
a companies.</span></p>
